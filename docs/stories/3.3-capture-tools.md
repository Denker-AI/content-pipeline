# Story 3.3: Capture Tools (Screenshot + Video)

## Goal

Add PNG screenshot and video recording buttons to the preview toolbar. Uses Playwright (bundled with the app) to capture at exact dimensions.

## Dependencies

- Story 2.2 (preview renderer)
- Story 3.2 (component preview)

## Files to Create/Edit

```
src/main/screenshot.ts                     # Playwright screenshot + video
src/main/capture.ts                        # Overlay composition
src/main/ipc.ts                            # Update: capture IPC channels
src/renderer/components/capture-toolbar.tsx # PNG/video buttons + size presets
src/renderer/components/size-presets.ts     # Preset dimensions
```

## Size Presets

| Name | Width | Height | Use Case |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| LinkedIn Carousel | 1080 | 1350 | Carousel slides |
| OG Image | 1200 | 627 | Social media sharing |
| Newsletter Hero | 600 | 300 | Email header image |
| Custom | user input | user input | Any size |

## Implementation

**Screenshot:**
1. User clicks "Capture PNG" and selects a size preset
2. Main process launches Playwright (headless Chromium)
3. Navigates to the preview URL (same content as preview pane)
4. Sets viewport to exact dimensions
5. Takes screenshot → saves to `content/screenshots/` or `content/linkedin/.../carousel-images/`
6. Reports file path and size in status bar

**Video:**
1. User clicks "Record Video" with duration (default 5s)
2. Playwright records the preview page
3. Saves to `content/videos/`
4. Format: MP4 (default), GIF option

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Capture PNG" button captures at selected dimensions
- [ ] Size preset dropdown with common sizes
- [ ] Screenshot saves to content directory
- [ ] "Record Video" captures page for set duration
- [ ] Status bar shows capture result (path + size)
- [ ] Works for both HTML content and localhost component previews

## Notes

- Playwright is bundled with the app (via `playwright-core` + bundled browsers)
- Screenshot should use `deviceScaleFactor: 2` for retina quality
- For carousel slides, auto-detect output path from current content directory
