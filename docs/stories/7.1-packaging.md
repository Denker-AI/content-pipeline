# Story 7.1: Packaging & Distribution

## Goal

Package the app for macOS (.dmg), Linux (.AppImage), and Windows (.exe). Set up GitHub Actions to build on git tags.

## Dependencies

- All previous stories (this is the final packaging step)

## Files to Create/Edit

```
electron-builder.yml                     # Build config for all platforms
.github/workflows/release.yml           # Build + publish on git tag
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `bun package` produces a .dmg on macOS
- [ ] electron-builder config covers macOS, Linux, Windows
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow builds all platforms on tag push
- [ ] Artifacts uploaded to GitHub releases
- [ ] Auto-updater config (electron-updater) checks for new versions

## Notes

- macOS: .dmg with drag-to-Applications
- Linux: AppImage (no install needed)
- Windows: NSIS installer
- Code signing can be added later
