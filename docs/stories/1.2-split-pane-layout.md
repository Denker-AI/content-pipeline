# Story 1.2: Split Pane Layout

## Goal

Implement the two-pane layout: left pane (terminal area) and right pane (preview area) with a draggable resizer between them.

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1 (scaffold)

## Files to Create/Edit

```
src/renderer/App.tsx                    # Update: add split pane layout
src/renderer/components/split-pane.tsx  # Resizable left/right panels
src/renderer/components/terminal-pane.tsx  # Left pane placeholder
src/renderer/components/preview-pane.tsx   # Right pane with tabs placeholder
src/renderer/components/status-bar.tsx     # Bottom status bar
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Window shows two panes side by side
- [ ] Draggable divider between panes (min 20% / max 80% each)
- [ ] Left pane has dark background (terminal area placeholder)
- [ ] Right pane has tab bar: [Content] [Components] [Library]
- [ ] Tabs switch between placeholder content
- [ ] Status bar at bottom shows: "Session: — | Cost: $0.00 | 0 tokens"
- [ ] Layout is responsive to window resize
- [ ] Default split: 50/50

## Notes

- Use a lightweight approach for split pane (CSS flexbox + drag handler)
- No external split-pane library needed — keep it simple
- Terminal pane just shows "Terminal will go here" for now
- Right pane tabs show "Content preview", "Component browser", "Content library"
