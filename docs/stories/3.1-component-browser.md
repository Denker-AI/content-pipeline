# Story 3.1: Component Browser

## Goal

The Components tab in the right pane shows React components found by Claude when searching the user's codebase. Components are displayed as clickable cards.

## Dependencies

- Story 1.4 (terminal output parsing)
- Story 1.2 (split pane)

## Files to Create/Edit

```
src/main/terminal-parser.ts              # Update: detect component search results
src/renderer/components/component-browser.tsx  # Component cards list
src/renderer/components/component-card.tsx     # Single component card
src/shared/types.ts                      # Update: component types
```

## How It Works

1. User asks Claude in terminal: "find components for the knowledge graph"
2. Claude searches codebase using Grep/Glob
3. Terminal parser detects component file paths in Claude's output
4. Component cards appear in the Components tab:
   - Component name (parsed from filename)
   - File path
   - Brief description (from nearby comments or props)
   - [Preview] button

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Components tab shows cards for detected React components
- [ ] Cards show component name, file path, and a Preview button
- [ ] Cards update as Claude finds more components
- [ ] Empty state: "Ask Claude to search for components"
- [ ] Preview button is clickable (but doesn't do anything yet — Story 3.2)

## Notes

- Component detection is heuristic — look for `.tsx` files in Claude's grep results
- Don't try to parse/analyze the component code in the app itself
- Just extract path + name from terminal output
