# Story 3.2: Component Preview

## Goal

When user clicks "Preview" on a component card, the preview pane loads `localhost:<port>/content-preview` where Claude has written a temp page rendering the real component with mock data.

## Dependencies

- Story 3.1 (component browser)
- Story 2.2 (preview renderer)

## Files to Create/Edit

```
src/renderer/components/component-preview.tsx  # Webview showing localhost URL
src/renderer/components/component-browser.tsx  # Update: wire Preview button
src/renderer/components/preview-pane.tsx       # Update: switch to component preview mode
```

## Flow

1. User clicks "Preview" on a component card
2. App types a message into the terminal (via PTY): "Create a preview page for <ComponentName> at <path> with realistic mock data. Write it to app/content-preview/page.tsx"
3. Claude writes the preview page (imports the real component, generates mock data)
4. User's dev server (HMR) picks up the change
5. Preview pane loads `http://localhost:3000/content-preview` (or configured app URL)
6. Real component renders with mock data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clicking Preview types a prompt into the terminal
- [ ] Preview pane shows the component rendered from localhost
- [ ] User can iterate: "add more nodes", "change to dark mode"
- [ ] Works with the user's running dev server

## Notes

- The "type into terminal" is literally writing to the PTY — same as if the user typed it
- App URL is configurable in settings (default: localhost:3000)
- Don't try to render components inside Electron directly — use the user's dev server
